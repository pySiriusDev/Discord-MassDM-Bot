## What is this?
A Discord server bot that automatically sends messages to a certain number of members.

## How to use
**An important warning: if you are here, I will assume that you already know how a bot works on discord and how to develop in python, I will not teach any of these 2 topics here.**
<br>
**Come on...**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
1. Configure the **`.env`** file located in the bot's root folder.
2. Run the **`bot.py`** file by clicking twice or via the command line:
```
python bot.py
```
3. After placing the bot inside your server, just run the command in some text channel:
```
.dm 500 WEBHOOK_URL
```
Where **`.dm`** is the prefix previously configured in the **`.env`** file with the command that calls the bot function, **`.500`** is the number of members for which the bot will send the message, and **`WEBHOOK_URL`** is the url of your webhook, where you will receive the log of everything the bot is doing while the task is running.
